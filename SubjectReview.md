# Subject Review MAIDICO
Overall, the lessons were very interesting. As I have a technical background, many of the theories were new to me. It gave an insight into how to tackle today's problems using economic means - a facet that was clearly missing before. However, I didn't find the assignments to solve case studies too enriching. For my taste, it would have been better to solve the case studies together in class.
As an example:
- Short input from the lecturer with the presentation of the company and the problem
- Then divide into groups to solve the first part, i.e. find a strategy on how to approach the East Asian market with a specific product
- Discuss the different opinions
- Short input on the next "problem", group work, discussion and so on

It would be helpful to really involve everyone instead of just letting the presenting group work on the whole case.
